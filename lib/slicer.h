/**
 * @brief This class is used to step through an ND array in order of
 * dimensions, but unlike Slicer it breaks the NDArray into chunks. Iteration
 * stops at the end of each chunk until nextChunk is called. By default only
 * one chunk is used, equal to the entire image. Use setBreaks() to set the
 * frequency of chunks. The input to setBreaks() is an array of integers, where
 * the next chunk occurs when dist%break == 0, with the special property that
 * break=0 indicates no breaks for the dimension. So for a 3D image,
 * setBreaks({1,0,0}) will stop every time a new x-values is reached. Note that
 * the affects the order of iteration, so x cannot be the fastest iterator.
 * setChunkSize() is an alias for setBreaks. Note that in cases where
 * break%size != 0, for example image size = 5 and break = 3, chunk sizes will
 * differ during the course of iteration!
 *
 * Order may still be set to decide the order of iteration. The first member
 * of setOrder will be the fastest moving, and the last will be the slowest.
 * Any dimensions not included in the order vector will be slower than the last
 * member of order. Note that order will not necessarily be strictly obeyed
 * when more than one chunk size is > 0. For isntance if setBreaks({1,1,0}), 
 * setOrder({0,1,2}) are used, then all of 2 will visited before we iterate in
 * 0 or 1, because otherwise we would be stepping across chunks.
