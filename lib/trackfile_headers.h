//id_string[6]    char 6       ID string for track file. The first 5
//                             characters must be "TRACK".
//dim[3]          short int    Dimension of the image volume.
//voxel_size[3]   float        Voxel size of the image volume.
//origin[3]       float        Origin of the image volume. This field is not yet
//                             being used by TrackVis. That means the origin is
//                             always (0, 0, 0).
//n_scalars    short int 2     Number of scalars saved at each track point
//                             (besides x, y and z coordinates).
//scalar_name[10][20] char     Name of each scalar. Can not be longer than
//                             20 characters each.
//n_properties    short int    Number of properties saved at each track.
//property_name[10][20] char   Name of each property. Can not be longer than
//                             20 characters each. Can only store up to 10 names.
//vox_to_ras[4][4] float       4x4 matrix for voxel to RAS (crs to xyz)
//                             transformation. If vox_to_ras[3][3] is 0, it
//                             means the matrix is not recorded. This field is
//                             added from version 2.
//reserved[444]    char        Reserved space for future version.
//voxel_order[4]   char        Storing order of the original image data. Explained here.
//pad2[4]    char 4            Paddings.
//image_orientation_patient[6] float 24 Image orientation of the original image.
//                             As defined in the DICOM header.
//pad1[2]    char 2            Paddings.
//invert_x   unsigned char    1 Inversion/rotation flags used to generate
//           this track file. For internal use only.

//                             0 means the number was NOT stored.
//version    int 4             Version number. Current version is 1.
//hdr_size    int 4            Size of the header. Used to determine byte swap.
//                             Should be 1000.

//
//Track #1    int 4            Number of points in this track, as m.

//                             numbers. First 3 float numbers are the
