/**
 * @brief Uses randomized subspace approximation to reduce the input matrix
 * (made up of blocks stored on disk with a given prefix). This assumes that
 * the matrix is a wide matrix (which is generally a good assumption in
 * fMRI) and that it therefore is better to reduce the number of columns.
 *
 * To achieve this, we transpose the algorithm of 4.4 from
 * Halko N, Martinsson P-G, Tropp J A. Finding structure with randomness:
 * Probabilistic algorithms for constructing approximate matrix decompositions.
