 * @file fmri_psd_ica.cpp Tool for performing ICA on multiple fMRI images by
 * first concatinating in space. This requires much less memory for the SVD
 * than concatinating in time. For more general usage you can optionally
 * perform ICA on Power Spectral Density, which makes the specific time-courses
 * irrelevent, and insteady groups data by frequency.
