Need to:
Test kernel slicer when setOrder/setWindow/setROI are set in different orders
Test slicer when setOrder/setROI are set in different orders

Next Features:
Improve interface for iterators/slicers? I don't realy like some of the

Paired iterators? Wraping iterator?

Add basic fMRI inference

motion correction

Fourier Transform?
