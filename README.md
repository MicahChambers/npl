ndarray
=======

N-Dimensional Array Class, with arbitrary type, using inheritance. Used as the base for an ND image. Optional cluster ordering for speed.

Next Features:
REMOVE ITERATOR, Slicers are simpler and essentially the same. Need to make the interface between kernel_slicer and slicer more uniform (remove vector requirements)

vector interp
motion correction
Resample Function
Kernel Function

Fourier Transform?
