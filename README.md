NPL: Neuro Programs and Libraries
=======

Need to:
Clean up accessors interface. Decide on parsimonius set that is also general
enough to get the job done. Allow Interpolates to take constant input (since
they don't have a set function anyway)

Next Features:
Improve interface for iterators/slicers? I don't realy like some of the
function names and argument orderings.
Paired iterators? Wraping iterator?

Add basic fMRI inference

motion correction

Fourier Transform?
